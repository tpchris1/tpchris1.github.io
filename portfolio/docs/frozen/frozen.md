3. When you first enter the app, you need to change your password or your payment method
    - If you choose to use **OTP(One-Time Pin)** as payment password, we would implement a mechanism to **"Freeze"** your access to the OTP.
    - If you choose change password, we would told you a secret key which you need to add to your own password. Together they form the whole password, and we would **"Freeze"** it before you buy anything. <br>
