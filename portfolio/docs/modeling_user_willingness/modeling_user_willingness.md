# Modeling user willingness of data contribution in online social networks

##### *Help to collect your data from social network faster*

## Introduction
1. A Python Machine Learning Model that helps to collect data from social network in a more efficient fashion
2. This is my Bachelor Thesis 

## Problem Research
Under the implementation of GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation) since 2018, Social network companies like Facebook and Twitter would apply more protection to their data. However, in order to research on topics regarding social networks, data collection would become harder. Hence, we would like to acquire the public data on social network and analyze them through machine learning model based on the individual elements and situational elements. Eventually, we would like to find users who are more likely to provide their private data through our model. 

## Analyze Process
### Questions
1. What is the relationship between the user willingness and their public data?
2. Generally there are ground truth for questions to be solved by ML models, however, is there such a ground truth in our question?
3. The young people are more likely to receive our survey instead of the elder ones. Will this cause any bias problem?
## Implementation Process
