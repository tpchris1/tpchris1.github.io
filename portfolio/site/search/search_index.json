Introduction This is a Arduino-based mobile Lego tank which can be controlled by an Android phone through Blynk The Tank Gen2 is the upgrade version of the Gen1 - FPGA-based one Since the Gen1 is rather small and not strong enough Gen2 has made a significantly big change compared with Gen1 Be sure to check Gen1 if you want more details for the background stories Feature It has two main structural parts Upper: Turrent Turrent can lift and turn left and right Turrent can fire Lower: Base Base can also turn left and right There are a total of 4 motors to drive the Turrent and the Base It has two front lights which can be manually controlled through push buttons It has an Ultrasonic sensor that can detect enemy upfront It has a Thermal sensor which can light up alarm RGB LED to certain temperature and humdity It has a Photon Resistor which can light up the front lights when environment is dark It has a Canon which can shoot Lego parts and is controlled by a solenoid Moving, Shooting and Lighting can be controlled by an Android Phone through Blynk The Tank communicates with the phone by Bluetooth through a HC05 Bluetooth Chip Parts Used TO BE FILLED Please refer to Architecture first Architecture Demo Development Phase 1: Base Structure Development Phase 2: Phone Working Development Phase 3: Torrent Moving Development Phase 4: Shooting Development Phase 5: Moving","title":"The Tank Gen2 - Arduino Based"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#the-tank-gen2-arduino-based","text":"","title":"The Tank Gen2 - Arduino Based"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#a-lego-tank","text":"","title":"A Lego Tank!!"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#introduction","text":"This is a Arduino-based mobile Lego tank which can be controlled by an Android phone through Blynk The Tank Gen2 is the upgrade version of the Gen1 - FPGA-based one Since the Gen1 is rather small and not strong enough Gen2 has made a significantly big change compared with Gen1 Be sure to check Gen1 if you want more details for the background stories","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#feature","text":"It has two main structural parts Upper: Turrent Turrent can lift and turn left and right Turrent can fire Lower: Base Base can also turn left and right There are a total of 4 motors to drive the Turrent and the Base It has two front lights which can be manually controlled through push buttons It has an Ultrasonic sensor that can detect enemy upfront It has a Thermal sensor which can light up alarm RGB LED to certain temperature and humdity It has a Photon Resistor which can light up the front lights when environment is dark It has a Canon which can shoot Lego parts and is controlled by a solenoid Moving, Shooting and Lighting can be controlled by an Android Phone through Blynk The Tank communicates with the phone by Bluetooth through a HC05 Bluetooth Chip","title":"Feature"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#parts-used","text":"TO BE FILLED Please refer to Architecture first","title":"Parts Used"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#architecture","text":"","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_arduino/#demo","text":"Development Phase 1: Base Structure Development Phase 2: Phone Working Development Phase 3: Torrent Moving Development Phase 4: Shooting Development Phase 5: Moving","title":"Demo"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_fpga/","text":"The Tank Gen1 - FPGA Based","title":"The Tank Gen1 - FPGA Based"},{"location":"the_tank/the_tank_fpga/#the-tank-gen1-fpga-based","text":"","title":"The Tank Gen1 - FPGA Based"}]}
