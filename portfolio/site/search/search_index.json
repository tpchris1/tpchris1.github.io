However, in order to research on topics regarding social networks, data collection would become harder. Hence, we would like to acquire the public data on social network and analyze them through machine learning model based on the individual elements and situational elements. Eventually, we would like to find users who are more likely to provide their private data through our model. Analyze Process Questions What is the relationship between the user willingness and their public data? Generally there are ground truth for questions to be solved by ML models, however, is there such a ground truth in our question? The young people are more likely to receive our survey instead of the elder ones. Will this cause any bias problem? Lots of values on the public data would be missing, is it possible to solve the problem through preprocessing? How to select the model and refine it to increase accuracy and eventually reach the goal? Flowchart Flowchart of our model Current Research Comparioson Social network now plays an important role in everyone's life, therefore the protection of eyeryone's data becomes an important question. The following paragraph will focus solely on the relationship between user willingness and their behavior and data User Consent Analysis The elements which affect social group willingness are as following: Privacy Paradox Users care about their privacy when asked about, but they don't protect their privacy enough on the Internet Perceived Privacy Users' perception of privacy danger differ from the actual danger Context Users' more likely to trade their private data for services or benefits Culture Different culture treats privacy differently User Diversity Users' education background, personality and etc. affect how they react to privacy protection Gender Different gender treats privacy with different attitude We would conduct our research according to the above aspects in a data science perspective Implementation Process Data collection Collect the users' willingness through survey over Faceboook regarding: Whether they are willing to give their public account information to academic experiemnts without payment Whether they are willing to give their public account information to academic experiemnts with payment Whether they are willing to give their private account information to academic experiemnts without payment Whether they are willing to give their private account information to academic experiemnts with payment The survevry is distributed on multi different platform and channel to achieve as little bias as possible. Crawl the data according to users' willingness. Mostly their public account information such as personal data friend list liked posts number of posts We used selenium and Beautiful Soup and several bot afcebook accounts to crawl the above mentioned data The active data like posts and likes are crawled in a limited time frame Data Preprocessing The dimension of the raw data is quite high - for over 37 different attributes including educational background, working experience, birthday and etc. The raw data also has a quite high percentage of missing values. If one attribute has too high missing value, it will be removed. If low missing value, interpolation is used to fill up the missing value For Example, User ID is removed because it does not provide any meaning The raw data is then categorized using nominal feature, ordinal feature and temporal feature. If features are being too similar, we would combine the features together For nominal features, one-hot encoding is applied to remove bias. For some of the ordinal features, total and frequency over time can be calculated. As for the temporal features, most of these are binned up by a week or a month We categorized users' hometown and living place according to continentals using GeoMapping and Google Maps API. We sorted the educational backgrounds according to the QS and similar ranking standards The raw data is then divided into train data and test data using K-fold cross validation The raw data is scaled standardized and normalized as well The feature selection and extraction were then applied to the raw data. Such as Sequential Backward Selection to remove noises and LDA can select important features. Training We selected several models such as SVM, random forest, adaboost and xgboost which fits better with smaller dataset We applied SMOTE to do upsampling to balance the ratio of the positive and negative data We then use grid search to refine the parameter for the model Performance Conclusion The basic accuracy is around 72% After refining, the accuracy is now at 82% The accuracy can be further improved if more user data can be collected. Also, as described above, the users' willingness is highly related to one's personality as well, so maybe inspect the content of the posts to identify the personality would be a good break. Active Learning As our research move on to the next level, we found out that we lack of data Our research is 'small-dataset', 'low cost to achieve non-labelled data' and 'high cost to label each data'. Therefore, it is a perfect fit for Active Learning Our plan is to crawl large data on Facebook and ask the user about his or her willingness about giving the data, which can further used on training the model itself. Model of the Active Learning The action to pick up which users to ask is called query strategy The labeled data would then be feed to an AL Learner There are various query strategies the unlabelled data. Besides the default methods, we implemented our own query strategy These query strategies were combined and cross-validated through the grid-search The iteration can quickly convergent after 200 queries And the result of the different query strategies are as followed: Reference Laufer, R.

Introduction This is an FPGA-based mobile Lego tank which can be controlled through keyboard The FPGA is the Digilent Basys-3 Dev Kit developed under Vivado using Verilog The Tank is equipped with two 5V stepper motors powered by 4 AA 1.5V batteries The Tank is also equipped with another stepper motor to power the base of the canon which can fire Lego using solenoid Problem Research When my teammate and I decided to start this project, we had no clue of which components or parts we were going to use But we were very clear about what our goals are A Lego tank It can move It has a canon or turrent which can move It can fire Lego bricks It can be ccontrolled by some sort of controller Based on the above goals, we wanted to verify the feasibility of these goals First of all, we wanted to verify whether our FPGA board can drive a motor with load. After several discussion, we believe that the DC motor we could bought cannot provide enough torque. Hence, we chose stepper motors to drive the Tank Therefore, we tried to power the motors through a very simple experiment with some motors, some ULN2003 drive boards and some tissue, some wire and 4 AA batteries. It turned out to be pretty successful, then we can formally establish proposal of this project and go for next stage Feature The Tank can move forward and backward The Tank can move left and right The Tank can rotate the canon horizontally The Tank can make sounds when firing the canon The Tank can show the current status using 7-segment display The Tank can simulate an engine start and off using FSM The sketch design of the FSM for the Tank is as below Implementation Process The Lego structure is the very first important thing to finish because we needed to make sure that the structure was stongr enough to load these many parts on it Therefore, the base of the Tank is as below 3. Our ultimate goal for the Tank to be looking like this 4. Two stepper motors is placed vertically to reduce space problem and they were connected to Lego axis as the following picture The stepper motors drive the belt through straight bevel gear After the base structure, we tested the driving system of the motors. The motors are drive through ULN2003 to magnify the signal from 3.3V to 5V The signals were set as a shifting 4-bit register to represent the 4 phases of the stepper motor. 8. Nevertheless, the power is not strong enough to drive all three motors including the one rotating the platform for the canon 9. The solution was to use external power to solve the problem 10. While my partner worked on the keyboard control and functions like LED and 7-segments, I began to work on the fire mechanism. After several research, I decided to use solenoid to pull the \"trigger\" for the canon 11. The canon is built on a platform and another worm drive . The platform is driven by another stepper motor and the worm drive can be manually controlled 12. Eventually, all parts are combined together and the Tank is complete 13. During the final demo, because we lack of power we had to use different external power to power the Tank 14.
